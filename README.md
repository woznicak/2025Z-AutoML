## General rules and course assessment

You can obtain up to 100 points during the term, which will be assigned according to the following list:
- Homeworks (2 x 40 points)
- Presentations (2 x 10 points)

The grades will be given according to the table:

| Grade |  3 | 3.5 | 4 | 4.5 | 5 |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Points   | (50, 60] | (60, 70] | (70, 80] | (80, 90] | (90, âˆž) |
